Opensea Basic Bidding bot.

Just download it as .ZIP

Unpack it.
Download Node.js
Download Visual studio code

Run it in Visual Studio Code as any other node.js project.

npm install hdwalletprovider
npm install opensea-js
npm install enquirer

Put the stuff in config.json and pick a collection.

At time of this message the bot works fine doing about 30 bids/minute or 1800/hour on opensea

Im not using this opensea bidding bot anymore so yeah, gl.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Old NPM versions have problems with downloading the opensea-js library.
Easier way is to just download the whole file including node_modules from this .ZIP
