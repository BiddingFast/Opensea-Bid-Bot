Opensea Basic Bidding bot.

Just download it as .ZIP

Unpack it.

Run it in Visual Studio Code as any other node.js project.

Put the stuff in config.json and pick a collection.

At time of this message the bot works fine doing about 30 bids/minute or 1800/hour on opensea

Im not using this opensea bidding bot anymore so yeah, gl.
